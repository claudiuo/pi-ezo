# pi-ezo
code related to this adafruit tutorial: https://learn.adafruit.com/piezo-ring-tones-with-raspberry-pi/overview. original code by Roberto Marquez onebeartoe. I didn't fork the original project because it had a lot of modules in it but I was only interested in the pi-ezo code used in the tutorial mentioned above.
